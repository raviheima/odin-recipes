  <h2>What Is Schnitzel?</h2>

  <p>Schnitzel is a breaded and fried dish from Eastern Europe made with thinly sliced meat such as chicken, pork, or
    veal. The name comes from the German word "schnitt," meaning "cut."</p>

  <p>This baked version achieves a crispy texture without deep frying. Simply preheat your pan and drizzle the chicken
    with olive oil twice during baking.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Olive oil greases the pan, adds flavor, and prevents sticking (no deep frying required).
    </li>
    <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Chicken breasts are halved lengthwise and flattened to about ¼-inch thick.</li>
    <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps create a crunchy, crispy breading.</li>
    <li><strong>Paprika:</strong> Adds a smoky flavor to the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Two whole eggs bind the breading and help it stick to the chicken.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasoned Bread Crumbs:</strong> Use store-bought, panko, or homemade seasoned bread crumbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Lemon Zest:</strong> The zest of one lemon adds brightness and citrusy flavor to the breading.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare The Pan: </strong>Line a baking sheet with foil drizzled with olive oil. Place the pan in the
      preheated oven to ensure the pan is hot
      before the meat even touches it — this will ensure that the breading gets extra crispy during cooking.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare The Chicken: </strong>Pound the chicken breast halves with a meat mallet until they're about
      ¼-inch thick. Season the chicken with salt and
      pepper.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the Breading and Dredge: </strong>Make the breading with flour, paprika, eggs, bread crumbs, and
      lemon zest. Dredge the chicken in the bread crumb
      mixture.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook and Serve: </strong>Remove the baking sheet from the oven. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on
      the pan, then drizzle with more oil.
      Bake the chicken for five or six minutes. Flip and continue to cook until the chicken is no longer pink. An
      instant-read
      thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.</li>
  </ol>
