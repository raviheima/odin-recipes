  <h2>What Is Schnitzel?</h2>

  <p>Schnitzel is a breaded and fried dish from Eastern Europe made with thinly sliced meat such as chicken, pork, or
    veal. The name comes from the German word "schnitt," meaning "cut."</p>

  <p>This baked version achieves a crispy texture without deep frying. Simply preheat your pan and drizzle the chicken
    with olive oil twice during baking.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Olive oil greases the pan, adds flavor, and prevents sticking (no deep frying required).</li>
    <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> Chicken breasts are halved lengthwise and flattened to about Â¼-inch thick.</li>
    <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour helps create a crunchy, crispy breading.</li>
    <li><strong>Paprika:</strong> Adds a smoky flavor to the dish.</li>
    <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Two whole eggs bind the breading and help it stick to the chicken.</li>
    <li><strong>Seasoned Bread Crumbs:</strong> Use store-bought, panko, or homemade seasoned bread crumbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Lemon Zest:</strong> The zest of one lemon adds brightness and citrusy flavor to the breading.</li>
  </ul>
