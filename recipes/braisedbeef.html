    <h2>What is Braised Beef</h2>
    <p>Braising is a method of slowly cooking meat in a covered pot with liquid. This recipe braises chuck roast in beef
        broth and red wine.</p>

    <p>This hearty dish offers a rich, earthy flavor that's perfect alongside mashed potatoes, buttered noodles, or
        crusty bread.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ½ pounds boneless beef chuck roast</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, halved</li>
        <li>3 medium carrots, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, cut in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine</li>
        <li>3 sprigs thyme</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Preheat and Prep:</strong> Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Beef:</strong> Season beef pieces evenly on all sides with 3 ½ teaspoons salt, 2
            teaspoons pepper, and garlic powder.</li>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sear the Beef:</strong> Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add beef, reduce heat to
            medium-high and cook undisturbed until golden brown crust forms, about 4 minutes. Flip and brown all sides.
            Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables:</strong> Add butter to the drippings. Once melted, add onion, mushrooms, and
            carrots. Cook 5 minutes, stirring often and scraping up browned bits. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Deglaze and Combine:</strong> Stir in wine, scraping the pan. Return meat and juices to the pan. Add
            thyme, bay leaves, and Worcestershire.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Broth:</strong> Pour in beef broth until it comes up 2/3 of the way up the beef (don't fully
            submerge). Bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li><strong>Braise:</strong> Cover and place in preheated oven until meat is very tender, 2 to 2 ½ hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove from oven, garnish with parsley, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
